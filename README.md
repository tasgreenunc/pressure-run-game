# Pressure Run Game (MATLAB)

**Developer:** Ta'shawnna Green  
**Technologies Used:** MATLAB, App Designer, FSR, ADXL337 Accelerometer, DAQ, Signal Filtering

## ðŸ§  Overview
Pressure Run is a 2-player obstacle maze game built in MATLAB App Designer. Players control a dot using real-world sensors: an FSR for rightward movement and an accelerometer for up/down. The goal is to navigate through obstacles to reach a green flag.

## ðŸŽ® Features
- Force-sensitive resistor (FSR) controls forward X-axis movement  
- ADXL337 accelerometer controls Y-axis up/down movement  
- Obstacle collision detection  
- Win condition with flag visual and timer  
- Turn-based system with two players (red and blue)  
- DAQ interface integration  
- UNC-themed colors and design  
- Optional confetti animation and timer scoring
